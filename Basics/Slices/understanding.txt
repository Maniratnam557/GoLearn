A slice is a subset of an array 

slice are reference to data store somewhere else 

slice is dynamic data type

var s []int // exactly same as arry but doest have size

fmt.Println(s) [] nil 

s = []int{1,2,3}

s = append(s,10,15,20) 

s = slices.Delete(s,1,3) // remove indices 1,2 from slice


s = []int{1,2,3}
s1:= s S1 is copy of reference

s == s1 gives compile time error
