a:= 42 

b:= a 

what this gonna do its going to copy the value in a to b 
Note: These are values and they are copied a and b independent of each other 

if i change a= 27 then b doesnt effect 

Pointers:

b:= &a (holding the location in memory that a is pointing to)

b is set to point a 

*b this will give you 42 (derefrencing the pointer)
